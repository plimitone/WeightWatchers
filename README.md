Weight Watchers Exercises

Reverse String Exercise
- ```ReverseTheString.java```

*Mobile Exercise*
- Fool.com web page is used here

- ```PriceTestCompare.java```
  
  *This is for exercise three. As I had issues with my environment, what could not be completed is pseucode that walks through what ideally would be done*
  *Any work that could not be completed is commented out with multiline comments and pseudocode is included to walk through the logic.*
  
- ```WWObjectMap.java```
  
  *File would be used for storing all the attributes to be accessed. Would be referred to by their constant name from this file. Doing this saves changing items in multiple places if ANYTHING changes after automation starts. I used this strategy in other work and was beneficial.*
  
- ```WWExternalMethods.java```
  
  *External methods are here, such as startAppium and killAppium(), which would be used in almost every test case*
